For those who use celery please donâ€™t use it, there is an ACE Vulnerability (google if youâ€™re unfamiliar) within the software which means somebody could create a script could be focused on compromising your Discord account for example and obfuscate it then and claim something like itâ€™s a pet simulator script when in reality it could pull personal information. 

I strongly advice you not to use celery.

I would go on more about arbitrary remote executions but thatâ€™ll be too technical for most of you
